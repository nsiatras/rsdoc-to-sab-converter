.rsdoc to .sab Converter
------
<b>This software works only with DesignSpark Mechanical v2.0.</b>
Later DesignSpark versions unfortunately encrypts the .rsdoc file and the conversion fails.


A very simple tool to convert <b>DesignSpark Mechanical</b> .rsdoc files into Standard <b>ACIS Binary (SAB)</b> files.<br>
.sab files can be converted to STEP files easily, using several tools, and then be imported to CAM like SprutCam, Fusion360 etc.
